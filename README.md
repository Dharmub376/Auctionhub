### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd online-bidding-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for all projects**
   ```bash
   npm run install-deps
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auctionDB
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_in_production
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Cloudinary Configuration (Optional - for image uploads)
   # Sign up at https://cloudinary.com for free image hosting
   # CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   # CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   # CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   - **Local MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running on your system
   - **MongoDB Atlas**: Use your Atlas connection string in `MONGO_URI`

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Start both frontend and backend concurrently
   npm run dev
   
   # Or start them separately:
   npm run client    # Frontend only (http://localhost:5173)
   npm run server    # Backend only (http://localhost:5000)
   ```

### Individual Setup

#### Backend Setup (Server)
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create .env file with the variables shown above
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Setup (Client)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üìä MongoDB Setup

### Local MongoDB
1. Install MongoDB Community Edition
2. Start MongoDB service
3. The application will create the database and collections automatically

### MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get your connection string
4. Replace `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file with your Atlas connection string

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudinary Setup (Optional)

For image upload functionality:

1. **Create a Cloudinary Account**
   - Sign up at [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Free tier includes 25GB storage and 25GB bandwidth

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to your Cloudinary Dashboard
   - Copy your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

**Note**: If you don't set up Cloudinary, the image upload feature will not work, but the rest of the application will function normally.

## üîó API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile

### Products
- `GET /api/products` - Get all active products
- `POST /api/products` - Create new product with images (Sellers only)
- `GET /api/products/my-products` - Get seller's products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get single product with bid history
- `DELETE /api/products/:id/image/:imageId` - Delete product image

### Bids
- `POST /api/bids` - Place a bid (Buyers only)
- `GET /api/bids/my-bids` - Get user's bid history
- `GET /api/bids/:productId` - Get all bids for a product

## üéØ How It Works

### For Buyers
1. **Register/Login** as a buyer
2. **Browse Products** on the buyer dashboard with image galleries
3. **View Details** of interesting auctions with full image viewer
4. **Place Bids** in NRs before the countdown expires
5. **Track Your Bids** and auction results

### For Sellers
1. **Register/Login** as a seller
2. **List Products** with details, images, and auction duration
3. **Upload Images** using drag-and-drop interface
4. **Monitor Performance** through dashboard analytics in NRs
5. **Track Bidding** activity on your products
6. **Manage Auctions** and view final results

### Authentication Flow
1. Users register with basic information and role selection
2. JWT tokens are issued upon successful authentication
3. Tokens are stored in localStorage and sent with API requests
4. Role-based access controls restrict certain actions
5. Automatic token refresh and logout on expiration

### Bidding Process
1. Buyers can only bid on active auctions
2. Bids must be higher than the current highest bid
3. All amounts are displayed in Nepalese Rupees (NRs)
4. Real-time countdown timers show remaining time
5. Bidding is automatically disabled when time expires
6. Highest bidder wins the auction

### Image Upload Process
1. Sellers can upload up to 5 images per product
2. Drag-and-drop interface with instant preview
3. Images are automatically optimized and stored
4. Buyers can view images in a professional gallery
5. Lightbox viewer for detailed image inspection
